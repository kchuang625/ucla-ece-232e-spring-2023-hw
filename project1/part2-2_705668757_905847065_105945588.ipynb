    "#### (a) We are going to create a directed random network with 900 nodes, using the preferen- tial attachment model. Note that in a directed preferential attachment network, the out-degree of every node is m, while the in-degrees follow a power law distribution. One problem of performing random walk in such a network is that, the very first node will have no outbounding edges, and be a “black hole” which a random walker can never “escape” from. To address that, let’s generate another 900-node random network with preferential attachment model, and merge the two networks by adding the edges of the second graph to the first graph with a shuffling of the indices of the nodes. See below figure for example. Create such a network using m = 4. Measure the probability that the walker visits each node. Is this probability related to the degree of the nodes?\n",

    "#### (a) Suppose you have your own notion of importance. Your interest in a node is propor- tional to the node’s PageRank, because you totally rely upon Google to decide which website to visit (assume that these nodes represent websites). Again, use random walk on network generated in question 3 to simulate this personalized PageRank. Here the teleportation probability to each node is proportional to its PageRank (as opposed to the regular PageRank, where at teleportation, the chance of visiting all nodes are the same and equal to 1/N ). Again, let the teleportation probability be equal to α = 0.2. Compare the results with 3(a).\n",
