    "## 1. Stock Market\n",
    "***\n",
    "In this part of the project, we study data from stock market. The data is available on this [Dropbox Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/83l60htndqpn3fv/finance_data.zip?dl=0). The goal of this part is to study correlation structures among fluctuation patterns of stock prices using tools from graph theory. The intuition is that investors will have similar strategies of investment for stocks that are effected by the same economic factors. For example, the stocks belonging to the transportation sector may have different absolute prices, but if for example fuel prices change or are expected to change significantly in the near future, then you would expect the investors to buy or sell all stocks similarly and maximize their returns. Towards that goal, we construct different graphs based on similarities among the time series of returns on different stocks at different time scales (day vs a week). Then, we study properties of such graphs. The data is obtained from Yahoo Finance website for 3 years. You’re provided with a number of csv tables, each containing several fields: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adj Close price. The files are named according to Ticker Symbol of each stock. You may find the market sector for each company in Name sector.csv. We recommend doing this part of the project (Q1 - Q8) in R."
